The aim of this project was to use random trees and random forests to create a model which predicts the number of stars a Yelp! user has given a business, using information about the user as well as the words used in the review. 

**Report.pdf** contains the final project report, and **Slideshow.pdf** contains presentation slides for an accompanying talk.
